Octave-sublime3-plugin
======================

This is here because after 20 minutes of searching I had not found a ready made one.
  
If you are reading this and it's just one build command, then I either didn't need more or it's really early in the process.

#### Octave starts slow?

This might only apply to Windows, but I found that the startup time of the   [binaries](http://sourceforge.net/projects/octave/files/Octave%20Windows%20binaries/) for 
Octave for `Windows Microsoft Visual Studio` are much shorter than Octave for `Windows MinGW installer`.
